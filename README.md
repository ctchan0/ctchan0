<!-- About Me -->
## ⚡ About Me

I am a Developer passionate about building functional applications and interactive experiences. I enjoy combining **Computer Vision** (Pose Detection) with front-end technologies to control digital environments with physical movement. 

Alongside my experimental work in motion tracking and 3D rendering, I build practical, full-stack solutions for the pet industry, managing everything from server logic to user interface.
